# Who is PRIA?
The Practical Robotics Institute Austria (PRIA) is a non-profit organisation with the aim to promote scien-
tific and technical excellence in schools using robotics as well as the participation and operation of exemplary
research projects in fields related to robotics and automation and teaching methods by means of robotics.
The Practical Robotics Institute Austria is constituted as an independent non-profit organisation with a
scientific advisory board.

# Concept of this Project
Nowadays computers with ARM architecture are becomming more common. Various smartphones, as well
as sigle-board computers like Raspberry Pi are becomming cheaper and much more affordable. To be able
to use ARM Devices as robot controllers, some additional hardware that enables connecting and controlling
robot components such as sensors, motors and servos are required. The hardware (aka. Low-Level Control,
LLC) and the ARM devices(aka. High-Level Control, HLC) should be able to be connected together using
both wired and wireless communications.

Andrix Industry is the concept of implementing this kind of structure in an industrial environment and
its controller has to be relatively low-cost, stable and expandable for different uses.
In this project, we use a standard industrial conveyor belt to test our idea. We will connect our Andrix
controller (including an Raspberry Pi as the High level control) to an external Motor Controller (aka. Ex-
ternal Hardware Controller level) to be able to drive the conveyor belt using a Stepper Motor.
